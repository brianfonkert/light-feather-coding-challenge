# Front End Engineer Coding Challenge Submission

Brian Fonkert

## Requirements

This project requires the installation of node.js from (https://nodejs.org/en/).

With the project open, run `npm install` to install the project.

From there, `npm start` may be used to run the app in a local development preview server.

## Notes

Working on this challenge, I interpreted the requirements of the Email and Phone number fields to not be mutually exclusive.
To me, being able to select both methods for notifications made sense. The user is still required to have at least one of these methods selected
and entered before they are allowed to submit.

I implemented both of the optional features mentioned, and chose to style the form to match the LightFeather logo color scheme. The design is also responsive to device size.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
